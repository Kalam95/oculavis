Test Assignment 

## This repo contains 2 sub branches

### 1. pokemon_assignment: It contains an assinment using MVVM, Since its a small project some of network layer files are not used but created to showcase that how would i do those things if requried for example: SessionManager, SSLHandler.

### 2. debugging_test_websocket: Its was an already created project but having number of bugs.
I have resolved, crashes, duplicay, retain cycles within the code, UI issues, other memory leaks. I used profiling(alloocations and leacks from instruments), Memory graph from Xcode and UISnapshot or ViewHirarchy via XCode tools.
